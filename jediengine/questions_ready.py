Financial commentary: This is based on the financial results but are in the form of bullet points commenting on the changes over the past three years. This includes increase/decrease in revenues, profitability (EBITDA) and debt. Please do mention the reasoning behind the changes too. Other than these, try commenting on net working capital as well as capex, and any metric which has varied a lot in any of the year and their reasoning. We always want to understand the reasoning. In addition, provide maybe a bullet point on the outlook from any credit rating agency if available in their latest credit rating report. 

Format should be in the form of bullet points e.g. - During FY24 volume decreased 6.1% y-o-y to 39.5m units, reflecting customers’ inventory optimization strategies, longer than expected customer plant stoppages, and slower than expected shift toward e-mobility. - Revenues decreased 1.7% to $4.9b, as re-pricing and underutilized capacity commercial negotiations partially offset volume decline EBITDA increased by 9.4%, however, to $633m, on the back of cost-optimization measures, customer negotiations and the depreciation of the Mexican peso - In FY23, the incremental debt responded to transitory needs, derived from higher working capital and the setup of the three new facilities for the EV/SC segment - Moody's stable outlook reflects expectations of continued cost-cutting, deleveraging, and prudent liquidity management to support improving credit metrics through FY25
