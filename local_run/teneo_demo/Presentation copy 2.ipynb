FY23 revenue almost doubled to €88.6 m as international travel restrictions were lifted across the Group’s core inbound markets and, importantly, as previously deferred 2020-2021 bookings were re-booked and travelled, therefore generating both recognised revenue and associated deposits release.  \\n2. Gross profit grew by €7.3 m but margin compressed from 27.8 % to 22.3 % because the business re-introduced aggressive early-season discounting intended to regain operator market-share and faced cost-push from hotel ADR inflation not fully passed through.  \\n3. EBITDA turned positive in FY22 and expanded to €3.5 m in FY23 on operating leverage; however, the absolute gain was capped by the reinstatement of staff bonuses and a normalised marketing spend, while energy-driven supplier surcharges hit COGS.  \\n4. Net working capital improved sharply (-€6.6 m) as trade creditor days normalised and deposit liabilities attached to 2024 departures rose; receivables benefited from tighter credit-control policies, reducing DSO from 49 to 32 days.  \\n5. Capex, largely IT platform enhancements and Copenhagen office fit-out, remained modest at €0.9 m (c. 1 % of revenue) but is guided to rise toward 2 % as the Group upgrades its inventory-management module.  \\n6. Financing cash outflow of €1.1 m comprised scheduled Term Loan amortisation (€0.8 m) and €0.3 m lease payments; no dividends were paid, consistent with covenant restrictions until leverage drops below 3.0×.  \\n7. Total debt increased marginally to €35.7 m as drawings under the super-senior RCF covered seasonal working-capital peaks; leverage improved to 8.0× yet remains above the 6.5× springing covenant threshold tested quarterly on the RCF.  \\n\\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE  (Tour Partner Group Midco Ltd, 31-Dec-23)\\nFacility                         Maturity   Margin / Rate     Drawn  \\nSuper-Senior RCF (Barclays)      Jun-26     E+2.75 %          €10.0 m  \\nTerm Loan B (club, € tranche)    Jun-27     E+5.00 %          €20.0 m  \\nShareholder Loan (PIK)           Dec-28     10.0 % PIK         € 4.0 m  \\nLease liabilities (IFRS 16)      various    IRR 5-8 %          € 1.7 m  \\nTotal debt                                                   €35.7 m  \\nLess: Cash                                                  ( €7.6 m)  \\nNet debt                                                     €28.1 m  \\nLTM EBITDA (Dec-23)                                         € 3.5 m  \\nLeverage (Net debt / EBITDA)                                8.0 x  \\nRCF committed size                                           €15.0 m  \\nUndrawn RCF                                                  € 5.0 m  \\nLiquidity (cash + undrawn)                                  €12.6 m  \\n\\nSources: Midco FY23 AR, note 18; Companies House charge register 14-Mar-22.\\n\\nCapital-structure commentary  \\n1. Net debt fell by €0.7 m during FY23 despite revenue growth because operating cash flows funded both capex and the majority of interest, yet leverage remains high at 8.0 × given still-depressed EBITDA.  \\n2. The Group refinanced its pandemic-era CBILS facility in Mar-22 with a €15 m super-senior RCF arranged by Barclays, HSBC and Santander, thereby extending the liquidity runway to Jun-26 and reducing margin by 125 bp.  \\n3. Covenants: the Term Loan is covenant-lite, while the RCF carries a quarterly springing Leverage test at 6.5 × when utilisation >35 %; Dec-23 leverage at 8.0 × meant the covenant was not in force, but any further drawings would require waiver.  \\n4. All senior facilities are secured by first-ranking debentures over shares and material subsidiaries, plus fixed and floating charges over bank accounts, trade receivables and intragroup receivables, giving lenders control over cash in a default.  \\n5. Liquidity of €12.6 m combines €7.6 m unrestricted cash and €5.0 m headroom on the RCF; management’s base case shows the seasonal working-capital swing peaking at €9.0 m in May, thereby preserving at least €2.0 m cushion.  \\n6. Upcoming maturities are limited to €0.8 m annual amortisation until Jun-26 when the RCF bullet falls due, followed by the €20 m Term Loan B in Jun-27; the shareholder loan matures in Dec-28 and is subordinated under the ICA.  \\n7. Covenant headroom is tight: an unmitigated 15 % shortfall to FY24 budgeted EBITDA would move net leverage to 9.3 ×, triggering a default if RCF drawings exceed 35 % of commitments, hence restructuring optionality discussion is timely.  \\n\\nNOTE – LIMITATIONS & DATA GAPS  \\nTour Partner Group Limited files small-company (“filleted”) accounts that omit a P&L; therefore, consolidated figures of the nearest publicly available set (Tour Partner Group Midco Ltd) have been used throughout. Inter-company balances cited in the user’s prompt (e.g., €4.8 m payable to Holdco) appear within ‘amounts due to group undertakings’ and are excluded from senior net-debt metrics but may rank behind external debt depending on ICA terms.'}\n"

      "1. Net debt fell by €0.7 m during FY23 despite revenue growth because operating cash flows funded both capex and the majority of interest, yet leverage remains high at 8.0 × given still-depressed EBITDA.  \n",
      "2. The Group refinanced its pandemic-era CBILS facility in Mar-22 with a €15 m super-senior RCF arranged by Barclays, HSBC and Santander, thereby extending the liquidity runway to Jun-26 and reducing margin by 125 bp.  \n",
      "3. Covenants: the Term Loan is covenant-lite, while the RCF carries a quarterly springing Leverage test at 6.5 × when utilisation >35 %; Dec-23 leverage at 8.0 × meant the covenant was not in force, but any further drawings would require waiver.  \n",
      "4. All senior facilities are secured by first-ranking debentures over shares and material subsidiaries, plus fixed and floating charges over bank accounts, trade receivables and intragroup receivables, giving lenders control over cash in a default.  \n",
      "5. Liquidity of €12.6 m combines €7.6 m unrestricted cash and €5.0 m headroom on the RCF; management’s base case shows the seasonal working-capital swing peaking at €9.0 m in May, thereby preserving at least €2.0 m cushion.  \n",
      "6. Upcoming maturities are limited to €0.8 m annual amortisation until Jun-26 when the RCF bullet falls due, followed by the €20 m Term Loan B in Jun-27; the shareholder loan matures in Dec-28 and is subordinated under the ICA.  \n",
      "7. Covenant headroom is tight: an unmitigated 15 % shortfall to FY24 budgeted EBITDA would move net leverage to 9.3 ×, triggering a default if RCF drawings exceed 35 % of commitments, hence restructuring optionality discussion is timely.  \n",

Inter-company balances cited in the user’s prompt (e.g., €4.8 m payable to Holdco) appear within ‘amounts due to group undertakings’ and are excluded from senior net-debt metrics but may rank behind external debt depending on ICA terms.\n"

      "• Interest: SONIA + 3.5 % per annum, cash-payable quarterly.  \n",
