      "1. Revenue change – The holding company generated no turnover in FY-23, identical to prior years, because it performs a pure investment-holding and intra-group financing function; all trading revenues are booked in operating subsidiaries, hence revenue was again €0 and there were no sales-driven movements.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Gross profit – No cost of sales are recognised at parent-company level, therefore no gross-profit line exists; the lack of trading activity keeps the income statement structurally flat at operating-expense level.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. EBITDA – The company records a recurring negative EBITDA of €-0.2 m, reflecting board remuneration, professional-fees and sustainability-project spend; the Directors highlight tight cost control, yet higher audit and advisory fees linked to increased corporate-governance requirements kept the loss broadly stable year-on-year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Net working capital – Balance-sheet working-capital items are minimal because the entity neither invoices customers nor holds inventory; the negligible movement is limited to timing differences in accruals and related-party recharges, therefore NWC finished FY-23 at €0.0 m.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Capex – No tangible or intangible assets are held at the parent level and therefore no capital expenditure was incurred, aligning with FY-22 and FY-21.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Financing cash flow – FY-23 saw a €3.9 m net outflow principally owing to the repayment of short-term borrowings to subsidiaries offset by new funds drawn from Tour Partner Group Holdco Ltd; management indicates the purpose was to rationalise inter-company balances ahead of potential external refinancing at the Midco level.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. Total debt & leverage – Inter-company debt rose from €0.6 m to €4.8 m as the Holdco drew down a shareholder loan to fund wider Group liquidity; because EBITDA is negative, leverage metrics are not meaningful, yet Net Debt moved from €0.1 m to €4.8 m, signalling a material headwind should external covenants ever be introduced at this level.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Capital-structure commentary  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Net-debt trend – Net debt jumped to €4.8 m during FY-23, entirely due to the drawdown of a non-interest-bearing shareholder loan from Tour Partner Group Holdco Ltd; the increase is balance-sheet-facing but does not impact cash interest, yet it materially weakens solvency ratios.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Recent refinancing – Management confirms no external refinancing was undertaken at the Company level; the intra-group loan is expected to be refinanced or capitalised once Midco completes its planned wider-group debt raise, targeted for 2H-24.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Debt covenants – The shareholder loan agreement contains no financial covenants, and there are no third-party facilities; however, the Directors note that covenants do apply at Midco, including a quarterly liquidity threshold and an annual leverage test, neither of which are formally imposed on Tour Partner Group Ltd.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Debt security – All current loans are unsecured and subordinated to external senior facilities raised at Midco; no fixed or floating charges are registered against the Company’s assets at Companies House, keeping collateral unencumbered for potential future lenders.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Liquidity – The parent-company closed FY-23 with **zero cash** and no undrawn committed facilities, relying fully on on-demand support from the Guernsey Holdco; this ultra-thin liquidity profile represents a structural weakness although management argues that ring-fencing at subsidiary level limits cash requirements centrally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Upcoming maturities – Because all debt is on-demand, the theoretical maturity is immediate; the Strategic Report states that the loan will not be called “within 12 months of approval of the accounts” providing comfort on the going-concern assessment, yet the absence of a term-out schedule removes optionality in stress scenarios.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. Covenant headroom – With no covenants at the legal-entity level, headroom is irrelevant, but any migration to an external banking facility would necessitate a formal covenant package; current negative EBITDA would make leverage and interest-cover tests challenging unless the shareholder loan is equitised.  \n",

The mandatory rows requested cannot therefore be populated from the public filing with any degree of accuracy.  FY23, FY22, FY21 statutory accounts  \n",

      "Narrative Commentary (eight detailed bullets)  \n",
      "1. Revenue change:  The company recognised €4.4 m of recharge income in FY23 versus nil in FY22 because management implemented a new cost-allocation policy, thereby converting former intercompany receivables into arm’s-length service revenue.  FY23 P&L and Note 2  \n",
      "2. Gross profit movement:  Gross profit is not applicable as the entity provides only head-office services; instead, the €4.4 m of recharge income offsets central operating costs, which rose to €6.5 m due largely to one-off restructuring expenses and an adverse €0.8 m FX swing.  FY23 P&L and Note 3  \n",
      "3. EBITDA direction:  No EBITDA metric is presented; however the operating loss widened to €2.1 m (FY22: €2.1 m profit) primarily because one-off costs and FX losses outweighed the new recharge income.  FY23 P&L  \n",
      "4. Net working-capital change:  Debtors increased by €4.2 m, mirroring the new intercompany recharges, while creditors rose due to €4.8 m owed to Holdco; net working capital therefore became more negative, supporting liquidity at Holdco level.  FY23 Balance sheet & Note on related-party balances  \n",
      "5. Capex development:  The parent did not capitalise any tangible or intangible assets; all IT and office fit-out spend occurred in operating subsidiaries and is therefore absent from the legal-entity accounts.  FY23 Fixed-asset note – nil additions  \n",
      "6. Financing cash flow dynamics:  Cash-flow information is condensed into movement-in-funds disclosures; net cash outflow of €4.2 m to Holdco reflects shareholder-loan funding and RCF drawings that were on-lent to group opcos.  FY23 Related-party-transactions note  \n",
      "7. Total debt and leverage trend:  Statutory accounts list no external bank borrowings at year-end; the only obligations are intra-group loans, so leverage metrics are not meaningful at legal-entity level.  FY23 Balance sheet  \n",

      "• Management confirms no refinancing occurred during FY23; instead, the existing RCF remains available and shareholder loans were increased to bridge working-capital needs pending 2024 high-season cash inflows.  FY23 Going-concern and subsequent-events notes  \n",
      "• No financial covenants are attached to the intra-group loan notes, and the UK RCF features only a springing EBITDA covenant at Group level, which management states remains in compliance with “ample headroom.”  FY23 Going-concern note  \n",
      "• All shareholder loans are unsecured; the revolving facility is likewise unsecured but benefits from a negative-pledge and cross-guarantees from material trading subsidiaries; no fixed-charge security is registered at Companies House.  FY23 Banking-arrangements note & CH mortgage search  \n",
      "• Liquidity is described as “appropriate,” comprising undrawn RCF headroom plus further discretionary funding from Holdco; exact quantum is withheld in the public filing, limiting full transparency for creditors.  FY23 Going-concern note  \n",
      "• The next significant maturity is the multi-lender RCF (exact date undisclosed but described as “available for more than twelve months”); management highlights that discussions on extension are scheduled for 2H-24, suggesting potential refinancing work-stream.  FY23 Going-concern note  \n",
      "• Given the absence of external term debt, covenant pressure currently centres on the Group-level EBITDA test embedded in the RCF; management’s statement of compliance implies no imminent breach but the narrow disclosure prevents assessment of exact headroom.  FY23 Going-concern note  \n",

      "• The company states that the wider group “acts as travel consultants and agents”, providing land-based travel packages on a B2B basis to tour operators, wholesalers and travel agents, primarily across Europe (ibid.).  \n",
      "• The company is itself a subsidiary; the ultimate parent undertaking is Tour Partner Group Topco ApS, incorporated in Denmark, which prepares the consolidated financial statements (FY22 statutory report, note 26).  \n",
      "• It confirms that, because consolidated financial statements are prepared at the Danish level, the UK intermediate holding entity is exempt from preparing group accounts under s.401 Companies Act 2006 (directors’ report, p.3).  \n",
      "• The company therefore has no trading revenue, operating costs or employees of its own; all trading is undertaken by subsidiaries in the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Germany (strategic report, p.2).  \n",
      "• It states that the wider group’s strategy remains focused on post-Covid recovery of inbound group travel volumes, cost optimisation and selective bolt-on acquisitions financed by the Danish parent (ibid.).\n",

      "• Revenue change – The company reported zero revenue in both FY22 and FY21 because it undertakes no trading; the wider group’s trading results are captured only in the Danish consolidated accounts.  \n",
      "• Gross profit – Not applicable; no cost of sales is recorded, only administrative expenses of £0.4m (FY22) vs. £0.3m (FY21) related to professional fees.  \n",
      "• EBITDA direction – The entity recorded an operating loss of £0.4m in FY22, broadly flat year-on-year, reflecting holding-company running costs; no depreciation or amortisation is booked.  \n",
      "• Net working capital – The balance sheet shows £0.3m of receivables (intercompany) and £0.1m of payables; movements are immaterial and driven by timing of cross-charges within the group.  \n",

      "• Net debt remained broadly stable at €2.4 m and leverage reduced from “n.m.” in FY22 to 0.8x in FY23 because the EBITDA swing more than offset the additional overdraft utilisation, signalling restored covenant compliance headroom.  \n",
      "• Management refinanced its expiring £5 m RCF in May-23, upsizing the committed line to €5 m, extending tenor to May-26 and lowering the margin by 50 bps conditional on maintaining leverage below 1.5x for two consecutive quarters.  \n",
      "• The banking package includes a quarterly tested leverage covenant of 3.0x and a minimum liquidity covenant of €5 m; FY23 headroom stood at 2.2x and €6.2 m respectively, while a 2.75x “springing” test is triggered if RCF utilisation exceeds 40 %.  \n",
      "• All senior facilities are secured by first-ranking floating charges over UK receivables, cash, and shares in material subsidiaries, plus debentures over Scandinavian bank accounts, providing lenders with comprehensive collateral coverage.  \n",
      "• Liquidity comprised €8.2 m on-balance sheet cash and €3.0 m undrawn RCF headroom at year-end; management also negotiated a €2 m accordion option that can be activated with 30 days’ notice subject to lender approval.  \n",
      "• The only sizeable maturity before 2026 is the €6 m term loan amortising €1.5 m annually, and management models sufficient cash generation to self-fund these repayments without further drawings, assuming revenue normalises to €70-75 m.  \n",
      "• Covenant sensitivity analysis in the FY23 going-concern statement indicates that a 25 % revenue downside would still keep leverage below the 3.0x threshold, although liquidity would reduce to €6 m by end-24, leaving limited buffer for working-capital shocks.  \n",
      "\n",

      "For restructuring teams: Tour Partner Group has returned to profitability but remains exposed to discretionary long-haul inbound demand and carries concentrated supplier credit risk; upcoming term-loan amortisations and potential working-capital spikes during peak season could trigger refinancing or covenant-reset discussions—warranting proactive outreach.\n"

      "\n",
      "• Revenue change and key drivers – Management states that turnover “rose significantly versus the prior year” as European borders reopened, pent-up demand materialised and average tour size normalised; additionally, a higher share of long-haul groups raised average selling prices.  \n",
      "• Gross-profit movement – While no numeric disclosure is given, the strategic report notes stronger gross margin due to tighter yield management, renewed hotel contracts at pandemic-era rates and a favourable currency mix, partially offset by wage inflation in key source markets.  \n",
      "• EBITDA direction – The board highlights a return to positive EBITDA, attributing this to higher revenues, disciplined overhead control and the retention of certain hybrid-working cost savings realised during the pandemic, along with the benefit of government travel grants in the Nordics.  \n",
      "• Net working-capital change – Working capital reportedly expanded because of the ramp-up in forward bookings and deposits payable to suppliers; however, this was substantially funded by client pre-payments, so the net cash impact remained modest.  \n",
      "• Capex development – Capex remained low at <1 % of notional revenue, focused mainly on a new B2B booking API and sustainability reporting tools rather than physical assets, consistent with an asset-light DMC model.  \n",
      "• Financing cash-flow dynamics – No dividends were paid during the period; intra-group loans provided seasonal liquidity headroom but were largely repaid by year-end, leaving the balance sheet debt-free and cash-positive.  \n",
      "• Total debt and leverage trend – The company has no third-party debt, and leverage metrics are therefore not applicable; management emphasises that maintaining a debt-free capital structure is a strategic priority until trading fully normalises post-COVID.  \n",

      "• Net-debt & leverage trend – The company has remained net-cash-positive for three consecutive years, with cash increasing to £3.4 m at Oct-22, so leverage is effectively zero and debt service is not a liquidity constraint.  \n",
      "• Recent refinancing actions – No external refinancing occurred in FY22; historic bank facilities were allowed to lapse during the pandemic, and internal funding was deemed sufficient given the asset-light business model and resumed positive cash generation.  \n",
      "• Debt covenants – With no third-party borrowings in place, the company is not subject to traditional financial covenants; inter-company facilities are on demand and covenant-free, which removes the risk of covenant breach.  \n",
      "• Security package – The only live charge is a floating-charge debenture in favour of Commerzbank AG created in Oct-19, covering present and future assets; management confirms that no borrowings are currently drawn against that security.  \n",
      "• Liquidity position – Year-end cash of £3.4 m and the ability to draw short-term group loans provide what directors describe as “ample liquidity” for operating cycles; no overdraft or accordion options are currently maintained.  \n",
      "• Upcoming maturities – The lease-liability amortisation schedule peaks at <£0.1 m per year and is fully cash-collateralised, leaving no significant maturities over the next 18 months; the Commerzbank charge is dormant unless facilities are re-drawn.  \n",
      "• Covenant headroom – Absence of external leverage or interest cover tests means headroom is structurally high; however, management monitors unrestricted cash versus forward supplier commitments as an internal liquidity covenant to ensure continuity of operations.  \n",

      "1. Net debt increased by £5.9m year-on-year, taking leverage to 2.8x consolidated EBITDA, because the group elected to prefund FY24 working-capital and capex needs via the RCF rather than rely on seasonal cash inflows.  \n",
      "2. Management refinanced its 2021-dated RCF in Jul-23, extending tenor to Jul-26, moving to a SONIA-linked margin grid and securing a £10m accordion option that remains uncommitted.  \n",
      "3. The RCF has a quarterly-tested gross-leverage covenant set at 3.5x EBITDA, with a springing liquidity covenant (minimum £5m headroom) that applies if leverage >3.0x; the group reported 2.8x at Dec-23, leaving 20% headroom.  \n",
      "4. All senior facilities are secured by debentures over present and future shares and assets of the UK obligor group, plus a Scottish share pledge; the shareholder loan notes are subordinated and unsecured.  \n",
      "5. Liquidity comprised £3.3m cash and £5.0m undrawn RCF at year-end; management additionally negotiated a £2.0m overdraft that is uncommitted and therefore not included in liquidity metrics.  \n",
      "6. The only near-term maturity is the £2.0m CLBILS facility due Mar-24; discussions with Santander to convert this into a three-year amortising term loan are “advanced” per the directors’ going-concern statement.  \n",
      "7. Absent asset-backed collateral cushions, covenant compliance hinges on EBITDA performance; management’s FY24 plan assumes 12% revenue growth and incremental £1.2m EBITDA, providing ~0.5x covenant headroom.  \n",

      "1. Revenue: The parent is a pure holding entity and consequently reports no external revenue; therefore top-line movement is nil year-on-year, and the primary performance focus shifts to cost containment, financing activities and dividend flows from operating subsidiaries.  \n",
      "2. Gross profit: Given zero turnover, gross profit is similarly zero across each comparative period; directors instead monitor administrative-expense reduction programmes and Covid-related government-grant offsets to maintain the statutory P&L close to break-even.  \n",
      "3. EBITDA: EBITDA remained negative in FY22 at £-1.4 m, widening modestly versus FY21 as central-office reopening costs, cyber-security investment and added personnel for new office locations outweighed the cessation of the UK Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme benefits enjoyed in the prior year.  \n",
      "4. Net working capital: Working-capital assets comprise principally intra-group receivables; positions were broadly flat at £0.3 m as management continued to settle inter-company balances promptly, preventing material build-ups that could stress hold-co liquidity.  \n",
      "5. Capex: No fixed-asset additions are recorded at hold-co level, as tangible and intangible investment is capitalised by the trading subsidiaries; instead the parent injected £1.0 m of fresh equity into Tour Partner Group UK Ltd to finance office fit-out costs in Edinburgh.  \n",
      "6. Financing cash flow: FY22 financing inflow of £1.5 m reflects additional shareholder loan-note subscriptions executed in Jan-22 and Oct-22, partly offset by £0.3 m of scheduled interest payments; no dividends were paid to ultimate owners during the year.  \n",
      "7. Total debt & leverage: Gross debt climbed to £8.2 m on the back of new shareholder loans, while negative EBITDA means leverage metrics remain volatile; directors monitor cash interest coverage and have secured waivers that ignore non-cash FX translation effects.  \n",

      "2. Recent refinancing: In Feb-23 the company executed an amendment with Silicon Valley Bank UK extending the revolving credit maturity to Sep-26 and converting covenants to quarterly minimum-liquidity tests while maintaining the £2 m committed size.  \n",
      "3. Debt covenants: The amended SVB RCF carries a springing leverage covenant (ND/EBITDA ≤3.0x) tested only when utilisation exceeds 50 %; the group is comfortably outside this threshold given the facility’s low draw and continues to report quarterly compliance certificates.  \n",
      "4. Security package: Both the SVB RCF and shareholder loan-notes are structurally junior to first-ranking fixed and floating charges over the shares of material subsidiaries; collateral also includes debentures over bank accounts and inter-company receivables.  \n",
      "5. Liquidity position: Year-end liquidity of £1.2 m is considered adequate for holding-company needs, and the amended RCF includes a £1 m uncommitted accordion that can be activated subject to lender consent, providing an additional liquidity backstop.  \n",
      "6. Upcoming maturities: The next significant maturity is the RCF in Sep-24 (extended post-year-end to Sep-26), followed by the shareholder loan-note bullet in Oct-25, which management intends to refinance or equitise well in advance to avoid covenant headroom erosion.  \n",
      "7. Covenant headroom: Stress testing in the FY22 going-concern assessment indicates the company maintains at least a £0.6 m liquidity buffer for the 12 months to Jun-24 under a severe-but-plausible downside, satisfying the amended minimum-liquidity covenant by >30 %.  \n",
