Revenue rose £44.3m (+53 %) in FY23 as post-pandemic travel demand normalised, aided by a 30 % increase in passengers and higher average daily rates secured through dynamic contracting, while the Authentic Vacations acquisition added £8.1m of incremental turnover.  \\n2. Gross profit increased £6.4m to £25.7m but gross margin contracted 290 bps to 20.1 % because hotel ADR inflation was passed through to clients at lower mark-ups, and mix shifted toward lower-margin FIT business, partially offset by productivity gains from TPG Connect.  \\n3. EBITDA climbed £2.5m to £12.1m; however, the EBITDA margin narrowed to 9.5 % as staff costs normalised after government furlough schemes ended and marketing spend was reinstated to drive US demand, offsetting scale benefits.  \\n4. Net working capital outflow enlarged to £12.5m due to longer supplier pre-payment cycles and deposits paid to secure 2024 inventory, while trade receivables spiked in November-December bookings, exceeding the cash float received from operators.  \\n5. Capex doubled to £1.6m reflecting completion of phase-2 of the group’s booking engine and refurbishment of the new Copenhagen contracting office, in line with the Board-approved £4m digital roadmap (FY24-FY25).  \\n6. Financing cash usage of £0.9m reflects £3.0m scheduled term-loan amortisation, £0.5m IFRS-16 lease payments, partly offset by £2.6m RCF drawings to fund peak season working capital; no dividends were paid for the third consecutive year.  \\n7. Total debt increased £9.5m to £23.5m after the group drew the £10m accordion tranche in Aug-23, allowing it to hedge inventory pre-payments; nonetheless, leverage remained moderate at 1.0x EBITDA and within the 3.0x covenant.  \\n\\n=====================================================================\\n6.

      "1. Although the profit-and-loss account is not disclosed publicly, directors state in the Strategic Report that turnover “rebounded strongly post-pandemic, achieving more than six-fold growth year-on-year,” driven by the lifting of UK, Irish and Nordic travel restrictions and the re-opening of core German and US source markets.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Gross profit is similarly not disclosed, yet management note that margin improved versus FY21 because hotel contracting teams renegotiated minimum-room allotments to variable pricing and because USD and EUR strength against sterling boosted inbound receipts during the year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. EBITDA was “materially positive again” per directors, helped by the reversal of £3.2m of furlough support received in prior years and by a £1.0m one-off gain on disposal of a minority stake in a software JV; nevertheless, inflation in staff costs and supplier rates partially offset the improvement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Net working capital outflow of £4.2m reflected a sharp increase in trade receivables as European coach series resumed and a deliberate policy to extend payment terms to key operator clients, while trade payables lagged because many hotel suppliers demanded pre-payments to mitigate perceived credit risk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. FY22 capex of £1.9m (vs. £1.1m FY21) related mainly to completion of phase-2 of the proprietary TourConnect platform, installation of a new API layer for hotel inventory and the roll-out of Salesforce across all sales offices; the directors confirm these investments are expected to reduce manual quotation time by 30% in FY23.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Cash from financing of £6.4m comprised a £5.0m drawdown under the HSBC revolving credit facility to fund working-capital seasonality, plus £1.5m of new subordinated shareholder loan notes provided by Caledonia to finance the IT capex; no dividends were paid in FY22 or FY21 in line with covenant restrictions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. Total debt rose marginally to £24.5m as the RCF utilisation increased, whilst net debt fell because closing cash more than doubled to £7.7m; directors state leverage remained “below 2.5x on a covenant-EBITDA basis,” comfortably inside the 3.0x springing test, although absolute headroom narrowed by roughly £3m.  \n",

The senior bank package carries a single springing leverage covenant set at Net debt / covenant-EBITDA ≤3.0x, tested quarterly if utilisation exceeds 35% of total commitments; at 31-Dec-22 utilisation stood at 28% and therefore the covenant was not in test, but directors calculate theoretical headroom at £2.9m.  \n",

      "\n",
      "6. The next material maturity is the £7.2m amortising term loan due Dec-24, which amortises £2.4m annually; management has commenced discussions with HSBC to extend the term or fold the balance into the RCF, citing improved trading and the support of majority shareholder Caledonia.  \n",

      "7. Directors highlight that although liquidity is adequate for the base-case forecast, a “downside severe but plausible” scenario of renewed travel restrictions would trigger covenant testing from Q2-23; mitigating actions include drawing the accordion, seeking covenant holidays and accelerating the disposal of a non-core Scandinavian cruise subsidiary valued at c.£4m.  \n",
