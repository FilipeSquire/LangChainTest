Revenue rebounded sharply by £21.1 m in FY22 as border restrictions were lifted and pent-up leisure demand from North America and Asia converted into group bookings, while dynamic pricing through the Helios platform enabled the business to upsell ancillary experiences.  \\n2. Gross profit increased four-fold to £9.7 m and margin expanded 6.3 pp because higher utilisation of pre-contracted hotel allotments reduced average cost-per-bed, and fuel surcharges could be passed through to customers under cost-plus arrangements.  \\n3. EBITDA swung to a positive £1.3 m, reflecting operating leverage on incremental sales, but was tempered by the reinstatement of sales & marketing spend and cost-of-living wage uplifts across the European office network.  \\n4. Net working capital contracted £0.9 m despite volume growth, primarily because trade payables normalised faster than receivables, aided by stricter credit terms imposed on B2B agents and improved automation of billing cycles.  \\n5. Capex rose modestly to £0.8 m as the group completed the second phase of its cloud-based reservation system and refurbished its York back-office hub, with no significant property additions planned for FY23.  \\n6. Financing cash outflow of £1.5 m in FY22 reflected scheduled CLBILS amortisation of £1.0 m, lease repayments of £0.3 m and the final deferred consideration payment for the 2019 Irish Welcome acquisition; the company did not pay dividends for the third consecutive year.  \\n7. Total debt declined only marginally to £10.5 m, but net debt rose to £7.3 m due to cash burn in early-year low season; consequently leverage remains high at 5.6x, underscoring the importance of the planned refinancing ahead of the Oct-24 RCF maturity.  \\n\\n————————————————————————————————————————  \\n6.
